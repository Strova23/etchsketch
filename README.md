# Etch a Sketch

Took a while, and I almost gave up in the middle because I couldn't figure out how to make my grid dimension static --> I literally took a break for a whole day and contemplated life on why I couldn't do this. It turns out that some code I copied from stackoverflow about creating divs using javascript, had some small padding css that was completely messing up my code, and I spent a whole day refactoring everything about my code, even starting the whole project from scratch. After realizing the issue the rest of the project was actually much simpler than I expected. 

LESSONS: 
1. Try to understand EACH part of the code and how it works, especially things that are googled. 
2. Take things slowly, its very scary having to stare at a blank html screen and imagining that it will become a fully functioning website, however simple it may be. It scared me and made me less motivated everytime I thought about it. Simply creating small steps makes the process much easier to handle mentally.
3. Keep everything simple. --> all the complex functions are typically made up of a lot of small and simple functions. 
4. This whole project gave me a good understanding on the relationship between HTML and JS
